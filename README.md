## Introduction
Railway delays can significantly disrupt schedules and affect millions of passengers. This project involves processing and exploring delay data to prepare it for deeper analyses or modeling in the future.

---

## Features
- **Data Loading**: Import raw railway delay datasets for exploration.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data formats.
- **Exploratory Analysis Setup**: Basic inspection and preparation of data for further analysis.

---

## Tools and Libraries
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **Data Handling**: Pandas
  - **Basic Exploration**: NumPy

---

## Data Analysis Process
1. **Data Loading**:
   - Imported datasets into Python for inspection.
2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Addressed missing or inconsistent data entries.
   - Reformatted data for consistency and usability.
3. **Exploratory Setup**:
   - Summarized key metrics such as mean, median, and counts.
   - Prepared the dataset for potential future analysis, such as visualization or modeling.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/blessingitodo/High-Speed-Railway-Delay-Analysis.git
   cd railway-delays
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open and run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
   ```

---

## Future Work
- Add visualizations to better understand delay patterns and trends.
- Perform statistical tests to investigate potential delay causes.
- Integrate external data (e.g., weather conditions) to enhance the analysis.
- Build predictive models for forecasting delays.
